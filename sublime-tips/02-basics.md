# Sublime Tip \#2

This is the start of a series of posts to help you better utilize your most important tool in developing, your text editor. For this course we are recommending with that you start out with Sublime Text 2. If you have chosen a different editor, read the shortcuts below and find the equivalent actions in your chosen editor. As usual, ask your mentor if you have questions or would like these demostrated.

The goal of learning these shortcuts is to keep your hands on the keyboard as much as possible and to keep your hands in the same position on the keyboard. Using your mouse, arrow keys, etc. moves your hands from their normal position and slows your typing (coding) .

**Autocomplete**

Sublime by default gives you many autocomplete features. As you start typing a word you may get a context menu of possible choices. Pressing ``tab`` select the choice that is currently highlighted. Continue to type out the word until it becomes the highlighted choice, then press tab to finish the word.  This feature becomes more useful as your program gets bigger, as this context list will expand as you create methods and assign variables.

**Comment/Uncomment Lines**

No matter where the cursor is on the line, this shortcut will comment the whole line or uncomment if the line has already been made a comment. (In Ruby lines starting with ``#`` are comment lines, or lines that are not executed)

Comment/Uncomment: ``ctrl + /``

**Indent/Unindent Lines**



**Add line below current line**

Instead of moving your cursor to the end of the line and pressing ``enter``, use:

  Mac ``cmd + return``  |  Windows ``ctrl + return``

**Add line above current line**

Instead of moving your cursor to the beginning of the line and pressing ``enter`` and then moving the cursor up with the ``up arrow``, use:

  Mac ``cmd + shift + return``  |  Windows ``ctrl + shift + return``

**Delete current line**

Instead of highlighting the whole line with the mouse and then pressing delete, use:

 Mac ``cmd + x``  |  Windows ``ctrl + x``

**Move Cursor functions**

Unfortunately, Sublime doesn't have the greatest key commands for moving your cursor around. Next post I will demonstrate how to do simple customizations so that we can add/change the default key shortcuts to something more useful. By default, shorcuts in Sublime:

**Move Cursor (Mac)**

1. Go to end of line:       ``ctrl + e``
1. Go to beginning of line: ``ctrl + a``
1. Go to line below:        ``ctrl + n``
1. Go to line above:        ``ctrl + p``

Or use arrow keys.

**Move Cursor (Windows)**

1. Go to end of line:       ``ctrl + right arrow``
1. Go to beginning of line: ``ctrl + left arrow``
1. Go to line below:        ``down arrow``
1. Go to line above:        ``up arrow``
